        <h1 id="head">How Does Our Muscle Grow?</h1>
        <p id="para1">We all think that just working out at the gym..makes our muscle grow..which is kinda incomplete.
          What gym does is breakdown our muscle..While working out with weight..That causes micro tears in our tissue..in simple our tissue gets damaged..( not serious one but micro tears)
          So how does muscle grows?
          What makes muscle grow is our rest and recovery..the nutrition we eat ..they are responsible for the recovery of our damage tissue..when it comes to nutrition.. protein is what works for the recovery of muscles..
          Protein are the building block of muscle..they recover the damaged muscle and form new muscle..the continuous process of damaging tissue and recovering it ..forms new muscle and thats how our muscle grows..
          So if you cannot provide enough nutrition..our muscle simply breaks down rather than building..</p>
          <p id="para2">Our muscle needs 48 hrs for proper recovery..soo for example..if we trained chest today...it shouldn't be trained untill 48 hrs.. continuously training same muscle group day by day.. doesn't allow muscle to recover as its getting continuous pressure and not getting enough sleep
            Most important thing which is underrated when it comes to rest is sleep.. sleeping is the time we produce more testosterone hormone..which is responsible for muscle growth..also lack of sleep means poor recovery..(7-8hrs of sleep is necessary).</p>

        <h1 id="head2">How do we gain and loose weight?</h1>
        <p id="para3">Our body needs energy to perform certain task.our body needs energy for the proper function of our organs. We get those energy from the food we consume.Food gives us energy.. through which our body functions properly..The energy we get from the food is known as calories.so basically calories is just the unit to measure energy.
          So now ...for our maintenance how much calories we need?that depends on each individual.normally a female needs about 2000 calories a day and male needs 2500 but this is not a exact one!it depends on person to person...and many other factor. This is called maintenance calories
           Now what happens is ...suppose our maintenance calorie is 2000..if we eat food more than 2000 calorie( lets say 2500) in a day for long term...our body will use that 2000 calories..and that remaining 500 calories which we ate extra will be store as fat..our body will preserve it for future use!..and that's how we gain weight! Eating more that our maintenance calorie is known as calorie surplus
          What makes muscle grow is our rest and recovery..the nutrition we eat ..they are responsible for the recovery of our damage tissue..when it comes to nutrition.. protein is what works for the recovery of muscles..
          Protein are the building block of muscle..they recover the damaged muscle and form new muscle..the continuous process of damaging tissue and recovering it ..forms new muscle and thats how our muscle grows..
          So if you cannot provide enough nutrition..our muscle simply breaks down rather than building..</p>
          <p id="para4">For loosing weight
            We gotta eat in calorie deficit..that means eating less than our maintenance calories
            Lets say our maintenance calorie is 2000 and we are eating 1500 calorie..now what happens..is our body isn't getting enough calories.. since its lacking 500 calorie.. our body will take that calorie from our store fat ..and that will result in weight loss.</p>
